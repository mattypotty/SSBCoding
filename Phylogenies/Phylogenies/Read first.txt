#This is intended as a step by step instruction to how the phylogeny was made. 
#It also includes all data needed to redo the analyses or change any part of it.
#The uploaded trees have already been purged for outgrups and have had their branch lengths removed

#Step 1) Load the explained R-codes used to merge the phylogenies in the file called Explained r-codes.txt

#Step 2) Merge the 20 orders where the internal relationship is based on genetic data one by one. Each order is in a seperate folder.
#The file named "Order name" modificaitons has one of the trees for each family and each genus and all the codes needed to merge them. 
#If a full set of 1000 trees are desired all trees needs to be loaded from files called the genus or family name ".nex" and the codes run 1000 times
#(one for each tree for each analysis)
